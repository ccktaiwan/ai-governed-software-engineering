# Industry Context and Related Work
## Positioning AI-Governed Software Engineering

### 1. Purpose

This document provides industry context for the AI-governed software
engineering approach described in this repository.

The intent is not to benchmark specific companies, but to clarify
organizational patterns observed across the software industry.

---

### 2. Observed Industry Development Patterns

In most software organizations, development activity concentrates
heavily on implementation.

Architecture and governance are often:
- Informal
- Implicit
- Deferred until problems emerge

This pattern is common regardless of company size.

---

### 3. Top-Tier Engineering Organizations

Large technology companies with mature engineering cultures
exhibit distinct characteristics:

- Explicit architectural ownership
- Dedicated review and governance processes
- Separation between decision-making and implementation
- Long-term investment in documentation and consistency

These practices are costly and typically require large senior teams.

---

### 4. Typical Constraints in Most Organizations

Most companies operate under constraints such as:
- Limited senior engineering bandwidth
- Short delivery timelines
- High coordination cost
- Pressure to demonstrate visible progress

As a result, early-phase engineering work is compressed or skipped.

---

### 5. Current Use of AI in Software Development

Industry adoption of AI tools has focused primarily on:
- Code generation
- Debugging assistance
- Test generation

While these tools increase local productivity, they do not address
system-level issues such as architectural drift or governance gaps.

---

### 6. Gap Addressed by This Work

The approach documented in this repository addresses a specific gap:

How can architecture and governance work be performed when
organizational capacity is limited?

By treating AI as a governed participant rather than an autonomous agent,
this model enables architecture-first work without requiring large teams.

---

### 7. Relation to Existing Practices

This work aligns conceptually with:
- Architecture decision records (ADR)
- Design review processes
- Systems thinking in large-scale engineering

However, it differs by explicitly integrating AI under governance constraints.

---

### 8. Intended Audience

This repository is intended for:
- Senior engineers and architects
- Engineering managers and CTOs
- Organizations seeking to reduce long-term system risk

It is not intended as an introductory AI tutorial.

---

### 9. Positioning Summary

AI-governed software engineering does not replace
top-tier engineering practices.

It makes selected aspects of those practices accessible
under constrained organizational conditions.
