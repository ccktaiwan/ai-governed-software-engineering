Semantic Authority Notice

This repository does NOT define governance authority, semantic baselines,
or enforcement rules.

All authoritative governance definitions, interpretation precedence,
and semantic baselines reside exclusively in the `prospera-os` repository.

This repository serves as:
- An engineering whitepaper
- A reference implementation
- A demonstrative case study

Any governance-related content appearing here is descriptive only
and MUST be interpreted through the canonical definitions
in `prospera-os`.

In case of conflict, ambiguity, or inferred meaning,
`prospera-os` always takes precedence.
