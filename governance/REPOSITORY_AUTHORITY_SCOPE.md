# Repository Authority Scope
AI-Governed Software Engineering

Status: Canonical Authority Declaration  
Applies To: This repository and all derivative works  
Owner: Prospera Architecture Group  
Change Policy: Governance review required  

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the authority boundary of the
**AI-Governed Software Engineering** repository.

It exists to prevent scope ambiguity, role confusion,
and unintended coupling between engineering methodology
and system runtime definitions.

This document is normative.

---

## 2. Repository Role

This repository is a **methodology and governance reference repository**.

It defines:

• AI-governed software engineering principles  
• Five-phase engineering lifecycle models  
• Governance, review, and rejection mechanisms  
• Semantic authority and terminology stability rules  
• Codex participation constraints across engineering phases  

It serves as a **canonical reference** for how GPT + Codex
may participate in software engineering under governance.

---

## 3. Explicit Non-Responsibilities

This repository **does not** define or own:

• Runtime system behavior  
• Kernel or constitutional execution rules  
• Deterministic system specifications  
• Audience or capability matrices  
• Production state machines  
• Execution pipelines or orchestration logic  

Such definitions must reside in **system-level repositories**
(e.g. Prospera OS) and may only reference this repository
for governance methodology.

---

## 4. Relationship to System Repositories

System repositories (e.g. Prospera OS):

• MAY reference this repository for governance models  
• MAY adopt lifecycle or phase-gate concepts  
• MUST NOT treat this repository as a runtime authority  

This repository provides **how engineering decisions are governed**,
not **how systems behave at runtime**.

Authority Direction:

Methodology → System Design  
Never:
System Runtime → Methodology Override

---

## 5. Codex Interpretation Rules

When GPT / Codex operates within this repository:

• Treat all governance documents as canonical  
• Do not infer runtime behavior  
• Do not generate system-level specifications  
• Do not assume executable authority  

Codex participation is limited to:
• analysis
• governance reasoning
• lifecycle enforcement
• rejection justification

---

## 6. Change Control

Any modification to this document or other governance declarations
requires explicit governance review.

Unauthorized expansion of scope is considered a governance violation.

---

## 7. Summary Declaration

This repository defines:

→ **How AI is governed inside software engineering**

It does not define:

→ **How any specific software system executes**

This separation is intentional and mandatory.
