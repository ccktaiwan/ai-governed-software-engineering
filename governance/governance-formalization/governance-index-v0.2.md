This document is the authoritative governance index for version v0.2.

All governance specifications under this directory MUST be interpreted through this index. No governance rule, boundary, or constraint is valid unless it is referenced here.

This index serves as the single source of truth (SSOT) for governance formalization in AI-governed software engineering.

Purpose

This document defines the authoritative index and cross-reference map for Governance Formalization v0.2.

Its purpose is to provide a single navigable entry point for governance specifications, ensuring that all governance rules, boundaries, and enforcement mechanisms can be discovered, referenced, and audited deterministically.

This index establishes the governance layer’s single source of truth for v0.2.

Scope

This index applies to all governance specifications defined under Governance Formalization v0.2.

It does not introduce new governance rules and does not modify the content of referenced documents.

Governance Document Set

This section defines the complete set of governance documents that constitute Governance Formalization v0.2.

3.1 AI Participation Boundary

Document:

governance/governance-formalization/ai-participation-boundary-v0.2.md

Purpose:

Defines permitted, restricted, and prohibited AI participation modes.

Establishes non-delegable human authority boundaries.

Referenced By:

Authority Level Matrix.

Enforcement and Escalation Rules.

Future operational playbooks.

3.2 Authority Level Matrix

Document:

governance/governance-formalization/authority-level-matrix-v0.2.md

Purpose:

Allocates decision, execution, and review authority.

Prevents authority ambiguity and AI authority drift.

Referenced By:

Enforcement and Escalation Rules.

Audit and traceability requirements.

3.3 Enforcement and Escalation Rules

Document:

governance/governance-formalization/enforcement-and-escalation-rules-v0.2.md

Purpose:

Defines enforcement triggers and violation classification.

Establishes escalation paths and authority restoration mechanisms.

Referenced By:

Audit processes.

Release governance.

Incident response procedures.

3.4 Engineering Phase Boundary Specification

Document:

governance/governance-formalization/engineering-phase-boundary-v0.2.md

Purpose:

Defines phase-based applicability boundaries for governance specifications.

Clarifies when governance is advisory, binding, enforceable, or auditable.

Referenced By:

Governance audits.

Lifecycle compliance reviews.

Future operational and system-level specifications.

Cross-Reference Principles

All governance documents adhere to the following cross-reference rules.

Governance documents may reference each other explicitly.

Circular dependencies are permitted only at the index level.

No governance document may override another without explicit version increment.

All cross-references must specify document name and version.

Authority Hierarchy

In the event of interpretive conflict, authority precedence is as follows.

Governance Index and Cross-Reference Map v0.2.

Enforcement and Escalation Rules v0.2.

Authority Level Matrix v0.2.

AI Participation Boundary v0.2.

Engineering Phase Boundary Specification v0.2.

This hierarchy applies solely for governance interpretation and audit resolution.

Audit and Review Usage

Auditors and reviewers must use this index as the entry point for governance compliance verification.

Authority traceability checks.

AI participation boundary audits.

Engineering phase applicability audits.

Incident and escalation reviews.

Any governance review conducted without reference to this index is considered incomplete.

Versioning and Stability

This index is aligned with Governance Formalization v0.2.

Any addition, removal, or modification of governance documents requires index update, explicit version increment, and Governance Body approval.

The index must always reflect the complete and current governance document set.
