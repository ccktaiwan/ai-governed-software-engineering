This document defines the governance applicability boundaries across the software engineering lifecycle for version v0.2.

Scope

This specification applies to governance applicability across the software engineering lifecycle phases defined for version v0.2.

It does not define authority ownership, enforcement actions, AI behavior constraints, or escalation procedures.

This document serves solely as a phase-based boundary reference for determining when governance specifications may apply, defer, or escalate.


It specifies at which engineering phases governance rules apply, escalate, or defer, without introducing new authority, enforcement, or AI behavior rules.

This document is a subordinate governance specification.

It is NOT authoritative on its own.
All interpretations are valid only when referenced by `governance-index-v0.2.md`.

In case of conflict, ambiguity, or omission, the Governance Index takes precedence.
