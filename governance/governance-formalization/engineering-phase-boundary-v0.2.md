Status: Draft
Owner: Prospera Architecture Group
Category: Governance

This document defines the governance applicability boundaries across the software engineering lifecycle for version v0.2.

Scope

This specification applies to governance applicability across the software engineering lifecycle phases defined for version v0.2.

It does not define authority ownership, enforcement actions, AI behavior constraints, or escalation procedures.

This document serves solely as a phase-based boundary reference for determining when governance specifications may apply, defer, or escalate.

Engineering Phases Defined

For the purposes of governance applicability, the software engineering lifecycle for version v0.2 is defined using the following phases.

These phases are descriptive, not prescriptive. They define temporal and responsibility boundaries without imposing process or tooling requirements.

Phase 1: Problem Definition and System Framing

Activities include problem articulation, domain understanding, system boundary definition, and high-level intent alignment.

Phase 2: Architecture and Design Specification

Activities include architectural decomposition, interface definition, constraint specification, and authority boundary modeling.

Phase 3: Implementation and Construction

Activities include code authoring, configuration, integration, and AI-assisted execution under defined constraints.

Phase 4: Validation, Review, and Audit

Activities include verification, testing, review, auditability checks, and governance compliance assessment.

Phase 5: Deployment, Operation, and Evolution

Activities include release, monitoring, incident handling, iteration, and controlled system evolution.


It specifies at which engineering phases governance rules apply, escalate, or defer, without introducing new authority, enforcement, or AI behavior rules.

This document is a subordinate governance specification.

It is NOT authoritative on its own.
All interpretations are valid only when referenced by `governance-index-v0.2.md`.

In case of conflict, ambiguity, or omission, the Governance Index takes precedence.
