Engineering Phase Boundary Specification v0.2

Status: Draft
Owner: Prospera Architecture Group
Category: Governance


Purpose

This document defines the phase-based applicability boundaries of governance across the software engineering lifecycle for version v0.2.

Its purpose is to specify when governance specifications become applicable, binding, enforceable, or auditable, without introducing new authority definitions, enforcement mechanisms, or AI behavior constraints.


Scope

This specification applies to governance applicability across the software engineering lifecycle phases defined for version v0.2.

It does not define authority ownership, enforcement actions, AI behavior constraints, escalation procedures, or operational controls.

This document serves solely as a phase-based boundary reference for determining when existing governance specifications apply, defer, or escalate.


Engineering Phases Defined

For the purposes of governance applicability, the software engineering lifecycle for version v0.2 is defined using the following phases.

These phases are descriptive, not prescriptive. They define temporal and responsibility boundaries without imposing process, tooling, or workflow requirements.


Phase 1: Problem Definition and System Framing

Activities include problem articulation, domain understanding, system boundary definition, and high-level intent alignment.


Phase 2: Architecture and Design Specification

Activities include architectural decomposition, interface definition, constraint specification, and authority boundary modeling.


Phase 3: Implementation and Construction

Activities include code authoring, configuration, integration, and AI-assisted execution under defined constraints.


Phase 4: Validation, Review, and Audit

Activities include verification, testing, review, auditability checks, and governance compliance assessment.


Phase 5: Deployment, Operation, and Evolution

Activities include release, monitoring, incident handling, iteration, and controlled system evolution.


Governance Activation by Engineering Phase

Governance applicability varies by engineering phase. This document does not alter governance rules, but defines when existing governance specifications become applicable, enforceable, or auditable.


Phase 1: Problem Definition and System Framing

Governance is advisory and boundary-defining in this phase.

AI participation boundaries apply to problem framing, requirement interpretation, and intent articulation.

No enforcement or escalation mechanisms are triggered at this phase.


Phase 2: Architecture and Design Specification

Governance becomes structurally binding in this phase.

Authority allocation, AI participation constraints, and non-delegable decisions must conform to governance specifications.

Violations may be identified but are not escalated unless propagated downstream.


Phase 3: Implementation and Construction

Governance is operationally active in this phase.

AI participation boundaries and authority level definitions are enforceable.

Violations may trigger enforcement mechanisms defined in Enforcement and Escalation Rules.


Phase 4: Validation, Review, and Audit

Governance is fully auditable and reviewable in this phase.

All governance specifications apply for compliance verification, traceability, and authority confirmation.

Escalation and remediation procedures are mandatory where violations are confirmed.


Phase 5: Deployment, Operation, and Evolution

Governance governs change control, incident response, and system evolution.

All modifications must preserve governance compliance unless explicitly re-scoped by versioned governance updates.

This phase is subject to continuous governance monitoring and audit readiness.


Authority and Precedence

This document is a subordinate governance specification.

It is NOT authoritative on its own.

All interpretations are valid only when referenced by `governance-index-v0.2.md`.

In case of conflict, ambiguity, or omission, the Governance Index takes precedence.
