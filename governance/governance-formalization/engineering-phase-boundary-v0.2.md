This document defines the governance applicability boundaries across the software engineering lifecycle for version v0.2.

It specifies at which engineering phases governance rules apply, escalate, or defer, without introducing new authority, enforcement, or AI behavior rules.

This document is a subordinate governance specification.

It is NOT authoritative on its own.
All interpretations are valid only when referenced by `governance-index-v0.2.md`.

In case of conflict, ambiguity, or omission, the Governance Index takes precedence.
