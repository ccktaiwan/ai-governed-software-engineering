# AI-Governed Software Engineering

This repository contains an engineering whitepaper and playbook describing
how large language models such as GPT and Codex can be governed across the
five-phase software development model.

Rather than focusing on code generation, this work examines how AI can be
applied to architecture definition, boundary setting, and governance,
activities traditionally performed by senior engineering teams.

## Motivation

Most software organizations operate primarily in the implementation phase.
Architecture and governance are often skipped due to time pressure,
organizational constraints, or lack of authority.

This leads to recurring problems:
- Persistent debugging cycles
- Architectural drift
- Increasing long-term maintenance cost

This repository documents an alternative approach.

## The Five-Phase Engineering Model

1. Problem Framing
2. Architecture and Boundary Definition
3. Governance and Review
4. Implementation
5. Long-term Evolution

This work focuses on how AI can responsibly support Phases 1 and 2,
not only Phase 4.

## Core Contribution

- Defines AI as a governed participant within an engineering system
- Explains why most AI-assisted development fails at scale
- Demonstrates how one architect, assisted by AI, can perform work
  traditionally requiring large senior engineering teams

## Case Study

Prospera OS is used as a live case study to demonstrate:
- Architecture-first development
- Explicit governance before implementation
- Full-system auditing and normalization

All artifacts were produced incrementally with versioning and review.

## What This Repository Is Not

- Not a SaaS product
- Not a prompt collection
- Not a coding tutorial

This repository presents an engineering methodology and governance playbook.
